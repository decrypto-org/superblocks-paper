  Blocks in proof-of-work blockchains satisfy the proof-of-work equation $H(B)
  \leq T$. If additionally a block satisfies $H(B) \leq T2^{-\mu}$, it is called
  a \emph{superblock}. Superblocks play an important role in the construction of
  compact blockchain proofs which allows the compression of proof-of-work
  blockchains into so-called \emph{proof of proof-of-work} certificates. In this
  work, we measure the distribution of superblocks in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash,
  Ethereum and Monero testnets and mainnets. We find that superblock
  distribution within the blockchain follows expectation, hence we empirically
  verify that these blockchains are not under previously theoretically posed
  attacks of \emph{badness}. Given these empirical statistics, we discuss
  efficient ways to store the \emph{interlink} data structure, which contains
  the most recent superblocks preceding each block. We observe that, when
  constructing an interlink by collecting superblocks into a Merkle tree,
  repeated superblock references can be omitted with no harm to security. Hence,
  it is more efficient to store a set of superblocks rather than a list. We
  analytically prove that, in honest executions, this simple observation reduces
  the number of superblock references to half. We then verify our theoretical
  result by measuring the improvement over existing blockchains in terms of the
  interlink sizes (which we improve by $50\%$) and the sizes of succinct proofs
  of proof-of-work (which we improve by $6.6\%$) \TODO{TODO verify numbers}.
