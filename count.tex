\section{Superblock distributions in deployed cryptocurrencies}

We measured the superblock distribution of four proof-of-work cryptocurrencies:
Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Monero. Our results are illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig.btc-bch-superblocks}. As expected, half the blockchain blocks are
$1$-superblocks, $1/4$ of blocks are $2$-superblocks and generally approximately
$2^{-\mu}$ of the blockchain blocks are $\mu$-superblocks.
