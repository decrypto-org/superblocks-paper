\section{Empirical analysis of improvement}

In order to empirically assess the space efficiency of our improvement, we
measured the size of the interlink data structure in the case of interlink
\emph{lists}, the previously proposed format, and in the case of interlink
\emph{sets}, our newly proposed format. We performed our measurements on the
mainnet for both Bitcoin and Litecoin. Our results are illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig.set-list-vector-comparison} and are similar for both of these
coins.

The new data structure format yields savings of approximately $83\%$ on average.
Based on the theoretical analysis of Section~\ref{sec.construction}, we expect
to see approximately an improvement of $50\%$ in this structure. The extra
$33\%$ is due to the explosion of difficulty in the mining power in both
cryptocurrencies. The increased difficulty causes a lower variable difficulty
target, meaning that the lowest portions of the superblock levels remain
unoccupied, but are still accounted for in the interlink vector list approach.
