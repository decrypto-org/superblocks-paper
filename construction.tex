\section{Interlinks as sets of superblocks}

In superblock-enabled blockchains, the interlink vector stored in each block $B$
contains one pointer per superblock level $\mu$, namely a pointer to the most
recent superblock preceding $B$ of the respective level $\mu$. This
construction, known as an \emph{interlink list}, is realized by inductively
updating the interlink of the previous block, as shown in
Algorithm~\ref{alg.interlink}. Trivially, genesis has an empty interlink. By
convention genesis is of infinite level and we include it in every subsequent
interlink.

Here, we make the novel but simple observation that the interlink structure
constructed in this manner often contains duplicate pointers. In fact, as we
will show, most of the interlink pointers are duplicate. Space can be
saved by constructing an \emph{interlink set} instead. This construction is
shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg.interlink-set}.

Let $B^n_\mu \in \{0, 1\}$ denote the random variable containing the value of
the $\mu^{\text{th}}$ digit after $n$ turns. Then we have that:

\begin{align*}
\Pr[B^n_\mu = 1] =
\sum_{i = 1}^n 2^{-\mu} \prod_{j = i + 1}^n \sum_{\mu' = 1}^{\mu - 1} 2^{-\mu'} &=\\
\sum_{i = 1}^n 2^{-\mu} \prod_{j = i + 1}^n (1 - 2^{1 - \mu}) &=\\
\sum_{i = 1}^n 2^{-\mu} (1 - 2^{1 -\mu})^{n - (i + 1) + 1} &=\\
\sum_{i = 1}^n 2^{-\mu} (1 - 2^{1 -\mu})^{n - i} &=\\
2^{-\mu} \sum_{i = 1}^n (1 - 2^{1 -\mu})^{n - i} &=\\
\end{align*}
